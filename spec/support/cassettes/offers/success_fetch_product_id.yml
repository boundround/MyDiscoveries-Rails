        1: Ubud - Om Swastiastu! Welcome to Ubud, the arts and cultural centre of
        Bali. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm on Day 1. Please
        look for a note in the hotel lobby or ask reception where it will take place.
        Afterwards, perhaps head out to Gianyar night market to try some of the local
        cuisine. It''s an informal setup, but a great way to get a taste of the local
        culture and cuisine.\n\nNotes: Your room in Ubud is not air-conditioned but
        has a ceiling fan. Air conditioning is available for an additional cost -
        just ask the hotel reception.\n\nDay 2: Ubud - Led by your local guide, you
        will tour Ubud on foot today (approximately 3 hours). Along the way you''ll
        see the goings-on of daily village life, rice fields, an alang alang valley
        (wild grass that is used for making the roof on traditional buildings), and
        visit a local painting and handicraft area. The tour ends in central Ubud
        where you''ll have time to explore the many cafes, galleries and shops on
        your own. Today you''ll also visit Bumi Sehat, a local community-based health
        clinic whose mission is to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality.
        In the evening you will sit down to a traditional Kecak dance performance.
        Driven not by musical instruments but by human chanting, this fascinating
        theatrical performance is considered a highlight by many travellers.\n\nDay
        3: Sidemen - Set off by bicycle (approximately 3 hours) through backstreets,
        quaint villages and rice fields - a great way to meet the local people and
        take in the lovely views. Along the way, you''ll make stops for photo opportunities
        and to rest if you need to. There are plenty of opportunities to visit some
        of the small and intricately carved temples. Your ride concludes in Ubud.
        Next, head for the hills and the village of Sidemen, travelling by minivan
        (approximately 2 hours). Set against a backdrop of Bali''s highest peak, Mt
        Agung, the peaceful and friendly village of Sidemen is proof that Bali has
        pockets tucked away from the tourism the island is famous for. It''s a little
        cooler up here, thanks to the elevation.\n\nNotes: Bicycle helmets are included
        on your ride, and there is a support vehicle if the going gets too tough.\n\nDay
        4: Mt Batur - Take a morning walk (approximately 3-4 hours) around Sidemen,
        visiting the craftspeople of the local songket weaving industry. A traditional
        ''bungkus'' lunch is included. The walk is a great chance to take in the beautiful
        scenery. You can also cool off in the river nearby. Continuing your journey
        higher into the mountains, drive along the crater rim road to a fishing village
        on the edge of Lake Batur (approximately 2 hours). Volcanic Mt Batur (1,717
        m) sits inside a stark and spectacular caldera, and with Lake Batur below
        it''s a stunning sight. The lake supports the local fishing industry, while
        many of the villagers work as guides for the volcano climb. Your accommodation
        at the base of Mt Batur is a basic hotel with a restaurant. This is a great
        location at which to start tomorrow''s early morning trek without extra travelling
        time.\n\nNotes: There are often mosquitos and bugs around Lake Batur, so be
        sure to pack your insect repellent.\n\nDay 5: Lovina - Get up at 3 am this
        morning to walk to the summit of Mt Batur (approximately 1.5-2 hours). You''ll
        be glad you made the effort to rise early when you see the gorgeous sunrise
        over the valleys of Bali. On a clear morning, it''s possible to see all the
        way across the Lombok Strait to the peaks of Lombok''s Mt Rinjani. This may
        well be one of the most memorable parts of your trip. Do keep in mind, however,
        that the weather can be unpredictable and sometimes the view is obscured by
        clouds. After descending the volcano, there''s an option to soak in hot springs
        with fantastic views over the lake and caldera. Make the journey from the
        mountains to the small coastal town of Lovina (approximately 3 hours). Lovina
        is famous for the dolphins that patrol its coast. It''s also a great spot
        for fine food, traditional massage and yoga.\n\nNotes: The summit trail follows
        switchbacks over volcanic rocks and gravel, and in places the trail can be
        quite steep. A good level of fitness is required. You will also need appropriate
        walking shoes, a head torch, a waterproof jacket and sufficiently warm clothing
        for Mt Batur and Bedugul. These items are available for purchase in Bali,
        but you may prefer to bring them from home to ensure correct fit and quality.\n\nDay
        6: Lovina - Enjoy a day of snorkelling on Menjangan Island reef, a short boat
        ride from the coast (there will approximately 2 hours of travel in total).
        This island and its coral reefs are part of the Bali Barat National Park.  Enjoy
        some free time in Lovina this afternoon, exploring the sun-drenched coastline.
        Just be careful of rubbish in the water if you go swimming, as this can be
        a problem after bouts of stormy weather in the waters aroundMenjangan, as
        in other coastal areas in Bali.\n\nNotes: Intrepid no longer supports dolphin-watching
        trips as an optional activity, as there is little regulation of them, and
        many previous travellers have raised concerns over sightings of motorised
        boats pursuing dolphins.\n\nDay 7: Bedugul - Bring your swimming gear to visit
        today as our first stop is a visit to the small but more local Banjar Hot
        Springs. Continue to the tiny hilltop village of Munduk (approximately 1 hour).
        Walk through clove and coffee plantations to a hidden waterfall. \nVisit Lake
        Bratan nearby for delightful views of Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, a Hindu-Buddhist
        temple set on a small island in the lake. You''ll need to wear a traditional
        sarong while you visit the temple. \nContinue to Bedugul (approximately 1
        hour). This mountain town is nestled in the cool and misty highlands, in a
        volcanic lake region covered in lush vegetation. Your warm clothes may come
        in handy for early mornings and evenings here.\n\nNotes: Our accommodation
        here has no air conditioning, as it is not generally required in the cooler
        climate of Bedugul.\n\nDay 8: Sanur - Visit the Bali Botanical Gardens in
        Bedugal, where over 2000 species of plants from all over Indonesia are on
        display in a tranquil highland setting.\nContinue by minivan to Sanur (approx.
        2 hours), and enjoy some free time this afternoon.\nSanur''s white sand beach
        stretches along the coast for five kilometres, sheltered along its length
        by reef making it safe for swimming. You can enjoy a stroll along Bali''s
        first beachfront walk, chat with the locals as they too enjoy the sea and
        sun, watch the fishermen in the shallows or kick back and relax at one of
        the beachside restaurants. Sanur maintains its traditions and local customs
        and ancient temples are only a hop, skip and a jump from the beach.\nAs this
        is a combination trip, your group leader and the composition of your group
        may change at this location. There will be a group meeting to discuss the
        next stage of your itinerary and you''re welcome to attend, as this is a great
        chance to meet your new fellow travellers\n\nDay 9: Tetebatu - Travel by minivan
        from Sanur to the port of Padang Bai (approximately 1.5 hours). Then you''ll
        board a ferry that takes you from Bali to Lombok (4-7 hours). The ferry is
        a huge multi-level boat brimming with food hawkers offering interesting snacks,
        plus plenty of local passengers to meet. Although this journey is long, the
        ferry ride and the arrival into Lembar port can be quite an eye-opener, as
        both the scenery and culture of Lombok are very different to that of Bali.
        Take a bus to Tetebatu (3-4 hours). The hill retreat of Tetebatu is situated
        in the centre of Lombok, at the southern base of Mt Rinjani, and boasts spectacular
        views.\n\nDay 10: Tetebatu - Enjoy a guided walk through verdant rice fields
        and see how the farmers of this region have tended the land for centuries,
        still using traditional water buffalo ploughs. Climb a little higher and pass
        through clove and coffee plantations (walking time is approximately 2 hours).
        Visit the local village of Pringgasela to learn traditional weaving and enjoy
        a delicious Sasak feast. After returning to the hotel, you will travel to
        Masbagik village, which is noted for its pottery. Explore the village and
        see the process of pottery making, with the possibility to get down and dirty
        and try it for yourself. Then continue through the village and see the other
        products Masbagik is renowned for, such as tofu and soya bean.\n\nDay 11:
        Senaru - Travel by minibus around the spiritual centre and sleeping giant
        of the island, Mt Rinjani. Visit a market and local villages famous for their
        crafts, including bamboo weaving. (Total driving time is about 5 hours, but
        it will take most of the day to reach our destination at Senaru, as we stop
        a couple of times.) Senaru is a small, rustic village nestled between the
        base of Mt Rinjani and the edge of the jungle.\n\nNotes: We do not include
        a Mt Rinjani trek on this itinerary, but we do stay in the vicinity with great
        views of the mountain.\n\nDay 12: Gili Islands - Continue to the west coast
        today (approximately 2 hours). You will visit the spectacular Singang Gila
        waterfall. The Gili Islands (Tiga Gili) are an archipelago of three small
        islands - Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air. Transfer by small boat to
        the Gili Air where you can take in the breezy atmosphere and stroll down stunning
        white beaches that rival those of the neighbouring islands. Your hotel is
        about a 15-minute walk from the port. Your bags can be transported by Cidemo
        from the port to the hotel.\n\nNotes: Our accommodation on the island has
        private outdoor bathrooms, with a lockable external doors.\n\nDay 13: Gili
        Islands - Today you''ll get amongst the marine life, with a snorkelling trip
        around the crystal waters of Gili Air. After being fitted for snorkelling
        equipment, head out on a motorised wooden around the Gili Islands. Swim out
        straight off the boat and catch colourful scenes of fish and sea turtles in
        the water. You will make a few stops at different spots around the islands.
        When it''s over, you''ll feast on a delicious dinner of local seafood.\n\nNotes:
        This activity is subject to local weather conditions and may be cancelled
        due to rough seas.\n\nDay 14: Senggigi - Take a short boat trip back to Lombok
        (approximately 40 minutes) and transfer to your guesthouse in Senggigi (approximately
        1.5 hours). Ideally positioned to take in the glorious sunsets over nearby
        Bali, this renowned beach resort is the ideal place to relax and unwind. A
        great optional activity is to visit the Pura Batu Bolong, which is around
        2.5 km south down the coast from the resort. This is an important local Hindu
        temple and also a lovely spot to watch the sun go down.\n\nDay 15: Senggigi
        - Your trip comes to and end today. Perhaps extend your stay in Senggigi,
        or pre-book a departure transfer to Lombok Airport.","includes":"Included
